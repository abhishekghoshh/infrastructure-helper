## Aws core services

### Compute Services
These services provide the necessary resources for running applications and workloads in the cloud.

   - **AWS IAM**: Identity and Access Management service that allows you to manage user access and permissions securely.
   - **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing users to run virtual servers.
   - **Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**: Managed service for running Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane.
   - **Elastic Container Service (ECS)**: A highly scalable container orchestration service that supports Docker containers.
   - **AWS Fargate**: Serverless compute engine for containers, allowing users to run containers without managing servers.
   - **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing service that runs code in response to events, automatically managing the compute resources.


### Storage Services
These services are designed for storing data in various formats.

   - **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Object storage service that offers scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
   - **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed relational database service supporting various database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.
   - **DynamoDB**: Fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.


### Networking Services
Networking services facilitate communication between resources and manage traffic.

   - **VPC**: A VPC is a virtual private cloud that isolates your resources from other resources in the AWS cloud.
   - **Subnets**: A subnet is a range of IP addresses within a VPC. You can create public and private subnets. Public subnets have access to the internet, while private subnets do not.
   - **Security group**: A security group is a virtual firewall that controls traffic to and from your EC2 instances.
   - **Internet Gateway**: A gateway connects your VPC to other networks. There are different types of gateways, such as internet gateways and NAT gateways.
   - **Route Table**: A route table determines how traffic flows within a VPC. You can create custom route tables for your subnets.
   - **NAT Gateway**: A NAT Gateway in AWS is a managed Network Address Translation service that allows instances in private subnets to access the internet while preventing external services from initiating connections to those instances.
   - **NACL**: An NACL is a virtual firewall that controls traffic to and from your subnets.
   - **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances.
   - **Route 53**: Scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service designed to route end users to Internet applications.
   - **Amazon CloudFront**: Content Delivery Network (CDN) that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs with low latency.
   - **API Gateway**: Managed service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing APIs at any scale.


### Messaging Services
These services enable communication between distributed systems or components.

   - **SQS (Simple Queue Service)**: Fully managed message queuing service that enables decoupling of microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
   - **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: Managed messaging service for sending notifications from the cloud to subscribers or other applications.


### Security & Management Services
Services focused on governance, security, and resource management.

   - **Secrets Manager**: Protects access to applications, services, and IT resources without the upfront investment and on-going maintenance costs of operating your own infrastructure.
   - **AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)**: Open-source software development framework to define your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages.


### Monitoring & Observability Services
These services provide insights into application performance and resource utilization.

   - **CloudWatch**: Monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and applications that provides data and actionable insights to monitor applications.

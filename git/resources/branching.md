## Git branching model
```
# List all branches
git branch
git branch --list

# List all branches with remote branches
git branch -a

# How to create a new branch in Git:
# By default, you have one branch, the main branch. With this command, you can create a new branch. 
# Git won't switch to it automatically - you will need to do it manually with the next command.

git branch branch_name

# How to list branches in Git:
# You can view all created branches using the git branch command. 
# It will show a list of all branches and mark the current branch with an asterisk and highlight it in green.

git branch

# How to delete a branch in Git:
# When you are done working with a branch and have merged it, you can delete it using the command below
# Remove selected branch, if it is already merged into any other. (-D instead of -d forces deletion.)

git branch -d branch_name

# Force delete a local branch (whether merged or unmerged)
git branch -D <branch>

# Rename the current branch to <new_name>
git branch -m <new_name>

# How to check remote branches that Git is tracking:
# This command shows the name of all remote branches that Git is tracking for the current repository:
git branch -r

# display list commit in different branches
git branch -v

# display tracked branches
git branch -vv
```


## Switch branches
```
# How to switch to a newly created branch in Git:
# When you want to use a different or a newly created branch you can use this command:

git checkout branch_name
git switch branch_name

# How to create a branch in Git and switch to it immediately.
# In a single command, you can create and switch to a new branch right away.

git checkout -b branch_name

# Checking out (switching to) older commits. Checks out the third-to-last commit
git checkout HEAD~3

# Checking out (switching to) older commits
git checkout <commit_id>

# How to revert unstaged changes in Git:
git checkout filename
```



## How to merge two branches in Git
```
# To merge the history of the branch you are currently in with the branch_name, you will need to use the command below:
# Merging a branch into the main branch
# Join specified [branch_name] branch into your current branch (the one you are on currently).

git checkout main
git merge branch_name

# Merging a branch and creating a commit message
git merge --no-ff <other_branch>

# How to abort a conflicting merge in Git:
# If you want to throw a merge away and start over, you can run the following command:

git merge --abort
```

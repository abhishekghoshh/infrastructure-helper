## Push changes
```
# How to push changes to a remote repo in Git:
# When all your work is ready to be saved on a remote repository, you can push all changes using the command below:
git push

# Push a copy of local branch named branch to the remote repo
git push <remote_repo> branch~

# Delete a remote branch named branch (-d tag only works locally)
git push <remote_repo> :branch
git push <remote_repo> --delete branch

# How to push a new branch to a remote repo in Git:
# If you want to push a branch to a remote repository you can use the command below. Just remember to add -u to create the branch upstream
# Push local branch to remote repository. Set its copy as an upstream.

git push -u origin branch_name


# How to force a push request in Git: (-f flag or --force flag)
# This command will force a push request. This is usually fine for pull request branches because nobody else should have cloned them.
# But this isn't something that you want to do with public repos. Do not use the --force flag unless you're absolutely sure you know what you're doing.

git push -f origin branch_name


# How to remove a remote branch in Git:
# If you no longer need a remote branch you can remove it using the command below:

git push --delete origin branch_name_here


# Push all of your local branches to the specified remote.
git push <remote> --all

# Push local changes to the remote. Use --tags to push tags
# Tags aren't automatically pushed when you push a branch or use the --all flag. The --tags flag sends all of your local tags to the remote repo.

git push [--tags] [remote]
git push <remote> --tags
```
